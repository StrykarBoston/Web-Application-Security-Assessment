# Web Application Security Assessment

This project is part of my internship task, where I conducted a security assessment of a web application using the DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) Lab set up on my local machine. The scan was performed using OWASP ZAP, a widely used tool for identifying security vulnerabilities in web applications. This repository contains the details of the vulnerabilities identified and the proposed solutions to mitigate them.

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the process of conducting a web application security assessment. The target was a locally hosted DVWA Lab, and the scan was executed using OWASP ZAP. The primary goal was to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the application and suggest remediation steps to enhance the security posture.

## Setup
1. **DVWA Lab Setup**:
   - The DVWA Lab was set up on a Linux machine using `localhost` (127.0.0.1).
   - Ensure that you have DVWA installed and running on your machine.

2. **OWASP ZAP Installation**:
   - Download and install [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/download/) on your system.
   - Run OWASP ZAP and configure it to scan your local DVWA instance.

## Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set
- **Description**: The absence of a CSP header increases the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and other code injection attacks.
- **Solution**: Implement a CSP header in your HTTP response headers.

### 2. Directory Browsing
- **Description**: Directory browsing allows unauthorized access to the contents of directories on the server, exposing sensitive files.
- **Solution**: Disable directory browsing in the web server configuration.

### 3. Hidden File Found
- **Description**: Hidden files that are accessible via the web can expose sensitive information.
- **Solution**: Move hidden files outside the web root or restrict access using access controls.

### 4. Missing Anti-clickjacking Header
- **Description**: The absence of an anti-clickjacking header makes the application vulnerable to clickjacking attacks.
- **Solution**: Add the `X-Frame-Options` header to your HTTP responses.

### 5. Cookie without SameSite Attribute
- **Description**: Cookies without the SameSite attribute are vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Solution**: Set the SameSite attribute on cookies.

### 6. Server Leaks Version Information
- **Description**: The Server HTTP header reveals the version of the web server, potentially aiding attackers.
- **Solution**: Configure the web server to hide or modify the Server header.

### 7. X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing
- **Description**: Missing this header may allow MIME type sniffing, leading to XSS attacks.
- **Solution**: Add the `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header.

### 8. Authentication Request Identified
- **Description**: Weak authentication mechanisms can lead to unauthorized access.
- **Solution**: Implement strong authentication practices, including multi-factor authentication.

### 9. Session Management Response Identified
- **Description**: Improper session management can lead to session fixation or hijacking.
- **Solution**: Secure session management practices should be implemented.

### 10. User Agent Fuzzer
- **Description**: The application may not properly handle unexpected user-agent strings, leading to vulnerabilities.
- **Solution**: Validate and sanitize user-agent strings to prevent injection attacks.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the importance of conducting regular security assessments on web applications. By identifying and addressing these vulnerabilities, we can significantly reduce the risk of security breaches and ensure a more secure application environment.
